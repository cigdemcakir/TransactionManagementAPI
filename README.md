# Transaction Management API

This project provides a basic Transaction Management API. The API allows you to create, update, list, delete, filter and sort financial transactions.

## Postman Collection

To simplify testing and interacting with the API, I provide a [Postman Collection](./TransactionManagementAPI.postman_collection.json). This collection includes pre-configured requests for all API endpoints. You can use Postman to import this collection and start testing the API immediately.

**Note:** Make sure to update the environment variables in Postman to match your local or deployed API URL.
